      <p>After leaving school I studied illustration at Swansea and graphic design at Swindon School of Art and Design. I then spent many years working in graphic design before teaching at Merthyr Tydfil College.<br>

I have always spent a lot of my spare time out and about, especially hill walking in the Brecon Beacons. Since developing an interest in photography at art college I started carrying a camera with me to capture views that caught my eye. My artwork is based on the photographs I take, but I don’t aim to just reproduce the photograph – I hope to enhance it. When a picture is nearing completion I put away the photograph and make the final touches as I think they should be from an artistic point of view. I very much like the idea of landscape painting outdoors but it is not practical in the remote places I like to go and I’ve usually got a big, bouncy dog with me who likes to keep on the move.<br>

I have always had a deep love of animals and feel a strong empathy with them. My first animal portrait was of my dog, Becky, back in 1994 which was the start of something I’ve been doing ever since. It gives me great pleasure to give an owner a portrait of their beloved companion especially when that pet is no longer with them.<br>

Flowers are a more recent subject matter of mine, inspired by my garden, and they suit my detailed style of painting.<br>

I work in pencil, watercolour and oil, depending on size and desired effect. The mediums of pencil and watercolour suit my natural talent for detailed illustration. But I just as much enjoy using the looser technique of  oil painting with a palette knife, wide brushes, rags and even my fingers.<br>

Whatever the subject matter I desire to capture the essence of beauty, either felt or seen.<br></p>
